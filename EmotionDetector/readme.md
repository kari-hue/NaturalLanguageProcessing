## Project Title: EmotionDetection

## Description of the project
Emotion Detector is a simple project this is used to detect what the person is exacltly feeling on the basis of the text he/she enters. The model is created using <b> Multinomial Naive Bayes </b> as well as <b> SVM Classifier </b>. 

#### Chain of events of the project:

* Text cleaning (Using neattext first and nltk library secondly)
* Exploratory data analysis on text data
* Data vectorization( Using countvectorizer first and Tf-fid secondly)
* Preliminary model construction using  <b> Multinomial Naive Bayes </b> as well as <b> SVM Classifier </b>.
* Model evaluation (Using metrics such as recall,precision, f1 score,confusion metrics)
* Some modifications and reimplementation of model

#### Result: Model accuracy didn't improved from 60%.

#### Important nlp library used in the project

* NLTK
* neattext
